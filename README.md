# Table4V - RISC-V Address Translation Simulator

Undergraduate project by Moshe Schorr.

Supervised by Asaf Slilat, Uzi Shvadron, and Tom Kolan at IBM Haifa.

## Usage

* Available online - <http://table4v.herokuapp.com/>
* Requires Python 3.8
* You can use the frontend (`flask run`) to run the server locally.
* For the backend usage, use `runjson.py`. It can handle very large test cases on the backend. On the frontend, the your browser rendering will come to a screeching halt. So if you're going to go for more than about a few hundred cases, use the backend.
